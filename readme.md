Cloudflare Workers
made-with-javascript

JioSaavn API adapted for Cloudflare Workers using JavaScript
NOTE: This is a Cloudflare Workers adaptation of the original JioSaavnAPI by cyberboysumanjay. You don't need to have JioSaavn link of the song in order to fetch the song details, you can directly search songs by their name. Fetching Songs/Albums/Playlists from URL is also supported in this API.
Features:
Currently the API can get the following details for a specific song in JSON format:
Song Name
Singer Name
Album Name
Album URL
Duration of Song
Song Thumbnail URL (Max Resolution)
Song Language
Download Link
Release Year
Album Art Link (Max Resolution)
Lyrics
.... and much more!

Benefits of Cloudflare Workers:
Global CDN: Your API will be served from Cloudflare's global network
Free Tier: Generous free tier with 100,000 requests/day
Auto-scaling: Automatically scales with traffic
Low Latency: Edge computing reduces response times
DDoS Protection: Built-in DDoS protection
SSL/TLS: Automatic SSL certificate management
Rate Limiting:
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse. You can use Cloudflare's built-in rate limiting or implement custom logic using Durable Objects.

Monitoring:
Cloudflare Workers provides built-in monitoring through the Cloudflare dashboard, including:

Request metrics
Error rates
Response times
CPU usage
Troubleshooting:
Common Issues:
CORS Errors: The API includes CORS headers, but ensure your client-side requests are properly configured
Decryption Failures: Some URLs may fail to decrypt due to changes in JioSaavn's encryption
Rate Limiting: JioSaavn may rate limit requests; consider adding delays between requests
Debugging:
Use wrangler dev for local development and debugging:
